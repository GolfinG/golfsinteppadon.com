        <p>
          Featured in a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/03/seattle-band-map/">Wired.com article</a>, Seattle Band Map is an experimental map of local bands.
          The user-submitted bands connect to each other if they have played together or have shared a band member.
          The result is a monstrous spiderweb of the Seattle music scene.

        <p>
          The Stanford Symphony Orchestra website is where fans and members of the symphony to get the latest
          news on the group. I did a visual redesign and migrated them to Wordpress to make it easily editable. We timed the release of the new look with the debut of Stanford campus's new Bing Concert Hall in January 2013.

After spending many hours playing this 2-4 player board game, we felt the need for an automated way to sum up castle points. Mad Castles lets you input your castle and tells you how many points it is worth.

        <h3><a href="https://www.hellomonsterproject.com/">Hello Monster Project</a></h3>
        <p>
          Hello Monster Project is an independent clothing line. Working with their designers, I helped
          bring their site to Wordpress which allowed them to connect with their fans through a blog.

          Public Display of Insanity's website helps them connect to their fans through music. The site gives fans access to content including musician
          bios, event dates, online song clips, and pictures. I designed the Wordpress site for PDI, allowing the busy young artists to easily maintain their site.

        <p>
          Winsomewood, a furniture distributor, needed
          customers to be able to easily view their
          products online. Working with their designers, I
          helped redesign the site to bring their
          furniture listings to the web while maintaining
          a friendly look and feel.

        <h3><a href="https://www.virtuososheetmusic.com/">Virtuoso Sheet Music</a></h3>
        <p>
          Virtuoso is a concept sheet music device that is designed to replace a musician's
          sheet music library. Made for a UW Human Centered Design & Engineering class, our team gathered
          feedback from student musicians in an attempt to rediscover sheet music. I believe something like this will become
          the norm one day - just a matter of time.

        <h3><a href="https://www.golfsinteppadon.com/locator-demo">Warehouse Stock Locator</a></h3>
        <p>
          Part of a suite of web tools I made as a contractor for Winsome, Stock Locator takes existing textual ERP data and displays it
          as an easy-to-read map. Warehouse pickers can use their iPads to quickly inspect locations, search for items, or see which locations are low on
          quantity. This data used to be accessed through a text based DB query program at a computer terminal. These web tools
          help make information more readily accessible, improving warehouse efficiency and ultimately increasing # average items processed daily.
